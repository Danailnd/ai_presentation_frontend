run `ng lint`

# Build

1. run `ng build --configuration production`
2. copy all the files inside dist/browser

### Notes

- main-####.ts has a different name every time so the old has to be deleted manually
- all other files have the same name in every build
- Don't delete web.config! ... But if you did delete it - feel ashamed of yourelf, copy web.config.txt from this project, remove the the .txt part and paste it
